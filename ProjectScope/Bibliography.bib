	Abstract = {We offer a systematic analysis of the use of deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction. Its ability to extract features from a large set of raw data without relying on prior knowledge of predictors makes deep learning potentially attractive for stock market prediction at high frequencies. Deep learning algorithms vary considerably in the choice of network structure, activation function, and other model parameters, and their performance is known to depend heavily on the method of data representation. Our study attempts to provides a comprehensive and objective assessment of both the advantages and drawbacks of deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis and prediction. Using high-frequency intraday stock returns as input data, we examine the effects of three unsupervised feature extraction methods---principal component analysis, autoencoder, and the restricted Boltzmann machine---on the network's overall ability to predict future market behavior. Empirical results suggest that deep neural networks can extract additional information from the residuals of the autoregressive model and improve prediction performance; the same cannot be said when the autoregressive model is applied to the residuals of the network. Covariance estimation is also noticeably improved when the predictive network is applied to covariance-based market structure analysis. Our study offers practical insights and potentially useful directions for further investigation into how deep learning networks can be effectively used for stock market analysis and prediction.},

	Abstract = {Data driven streaming applications are quite common in modern multimedia and wireless applications, like for example video and audio processing. The main components of these applications are Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms. These algorithms are not extremely complex in terms of their structure and the operations that make up the algorithms are fairly simple (usually binary mathematical operations like addition and multiplication). What makes it challenging to implement and execute these algorithms efficiently is their large degree of fine-grained parallelism and the required throughput. DSP algorithms can usually be described as dataflow graphs with nodes corresponding to operations and edges between the nodes expressing data dependencies. A node fires, i.e. executes, as soon as all required input data has arrived at its input edge(s). To execute DSP algorithms efficiently while maintaining flexibility, coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) can be used. CGRAs are composed of a set of small, reconfigurable cores, interconnected in e.g. a two dimensional array. Each core by itself is not very powerful, yet the complete array of cores forms an efficient architecture with a high throughput due to its ability to efficiently execute operations in parallel. In this thesis, we present a CGRA targeted at data driven streaming DSP applications that contain a large degree of fine grained parallelism, such as matrix manipulations or filter algorithms. Along with the architecture, also a programming language is presented that can directly describe DSP applications as dataflow graphs which are then automatically mapped and executed on the architecture. In contrast to previously published work on CGRAs, the guiding principle and inspiration for the presented CGRA and its corresponding programming paradigm is the dataflow principle. The result of this work is a completely integrated framework targeted at streaming DSP algorithms, consisting of a CGRA, a programming language and a compiler. The complete system is based on dataflow principles. We conclude that by using an architecture that is based on dataflow principles and a corresponding programming paradigm that can directly express dataflow graphs, DSP algorithms can be implemented in a very intuitive and straightforward manner.},

	Abstract = {Today the hardware for embedded systems is often specified in VHDL. However, VHDL describes the system at a rather low level, which is cumbersome and may lead to design faults in large real life applications. There is a need of higher level abstraction mechanisms. In the embedded systems group of the University of Twente we are working on systematic and transformational methods to design hardware architectures, both multi core and single core. The main line in this approach is to start with a straightforward (often mathematical) specification of the problem. The next step is to find some adequate transformations on this specification, in particular to find specific optimizations, to be able to distribute the application over different cores. The result of these transformations is then translated into the functional programming language Haskell since Haskell is close to mathematics and such a translation often is straightforward. Besides, the Haskell code is executable, so one immediately has a simulation of the intended system. Next, the resulting Haskell specification is given to a compiler, called C{\"e}aSH (for CAES LAnguage for Synchronous Hardware) which translates the specification into VHDL. The resulting VHDL is synthesizable, so from there on standard VHDL-tooling can be used for synthesis. In this work we primarily focus on streaming applications: i.e. applications that can be modeled as data-flow graphs. At the moment the C{\"e}aSH system is ready in prototype form and in the presentation we will give several examples of how it can be used. In these examples it will be shown that the specification code is clear and concise. Furthermore, it is possible to use powerful abstraction mechanisms, such as polymorphism, higher order functions, pattern matching, lambda abstraction, partial application. These features allow a designer to describe circuits in a more natural and concise way than possible with the language elements found in the traditional hardware description languages.

	Abstract = {The amount of resources available on reconfigurable logic devices like FPGAs has seen a tremendous growth over the last thirty years. During this period, the amount of programmable resources (CLBs and RAMs) has increased by more than three orders of magnitude. Programming these reconfigurable architectures has been dominated by the hardware description languages VHDL and Verilog. However, it has become generally accepted that these languages do not provide adequate abstraction mechanisms to deliver the design productivity for designing more and more complex applications. To raise the abstraction level, techniques to translate high-level languages to hardware have been developed based on imperative languages like C. Parallelism is achieved by parallelization of for-loops. Whether parallelization of loops is possible, is determined using dependency analysis which is a very hard problem. To mitigate this problem, other abstractions are needed to express parallelism. In this thesis, parallelism is expressed using higher-order functions, an abstraction commonly used in functional programming languages. The main contribution of this thesis is a design methodology based on exploiting regularity of higher-order functions. A mathematical formula, e.g., a DSP algorithm, is first formulated using higher-order functions. Then, transformation rules are applied to these higher-order functions to distribute computations over space and time. Using these transformations, an optimal trade-off can be made between space and time. Finally, hardware is generated using the CLaSH compiler by translating the result of the transformation to VHDL. In this thesis, we derive transformation rules for several higher-order functions and prove that the transformations are meaning-preserving. After transformation, a mathematically equivalent description is derived in which the computations are distributed over space and time. The designer can control the amount of parallelism using a parameter that is introduced by the transformation. Transformation rules for both one-dimensional higher-order functions and two-dimensional higher- order functions have been derived and applied to several case studies: a dot product, a particle filter and stencil computations.},

However, it has become generally accepted that these languages do not provide adequate abstraction mechanisms to deliver the design productivity for designing more and more complex applications. To raise the abstraction level, techniques to translate high-level languages to hardware have been developed based on imperative languages like C. Parallelism is achieved by parallelization of for-loops. Whether parallelization of loops is possible, is determined using dependency analysis which is a very hard problem. To mitigate this problem, other abstractions are needed to express parallelism. In this thesis, parallelism is expressed using higher-order functions, an abstraction commonly used in functional programming languages. The main contribution of this thesis is a design methodology based on exploiting regularity of higher-order functions. A mathematical formula, e.g., a DSP algorithm, is first formulated using higher-order functions. Then, transformation rules are applied to these higher-order functions to distribute computations over space and time. Using these transformations, an optimal trade-off can be made between space and time. Finally, hardware is generated using the CLaSH compiler by translating the result of the transformation to VHDL. In this thesis, we derive transformation rules for several higher-order functions and prove that the transformations are meaning-preserving. After transformation, a mathematically equivalent description is derived in which the computations are distributed over space and time. The designer can control the amount of parallelism using a parameter that is introduced by the transformation. Transformation rules for both one-dimensional higher-order functions and two-dimensional higher- order functions have been derived and applied to several case studies: a dot product, a particle filter and stencil computations.},

Due to such features as higher-order functions and polymorphism, parameterization in functional hardware description languages is more natural than the parameterization support found in the more traditional hardware description languages, like VHDL and Verilog.

group of the University of Twente. ClaSH borrows both the syntax and semantics from the general-purpose functional programming language Haskell, meaning that circuit designers can define their circuits with regular Haskell syntax.

In this thesis, research is done on the co-simulation of ClaSH and traditional HDLs. The Verilog Procedural Interface (VPI), as defined in the IEEE 1364 standard, is used to set-up the communication and to control a Verilog simulator. An implementation is made, as will be described in this thesis, to show the practical feasibility of co-simulation of ClaSH and Verilog.},

	Abstract = {As embedded systems are becoming increasingly complex, the design process and verification have become very time-consuming. Additionally, specifying hardware manually in a low-level hardware description language like VHDL is usually an error-prone task. In our group, a tool (the ClaSH compiler) was developed to generate fully synthesisable VHDL code from a specification given in the functional programming language Haskell. In this paper, we present a comparison between two implementations of the same design by using ClaSH and hand-written VHDL. The design is a simple dataflow processor. As measures of interest area, performance, power consumption and source lines of code (SLOC) are used. The obtained results indicate that the ClaSH -generated VHDL code as well as the netlist after synthesis and place and route are functionally correct. The placed and routed hand-written VHDL code has also the correct behaviour. Furthermore, a similar performance is achieved. The power consumption is even lower for the ClaSH implementation. The SLOC for ClaSH is considerably smaller and it is possible to specify the design in a much higher level of abstraction compared to VHDL.},

In this paper we evaluate CλaSH on a complex DSP application, a Polyphase Filter Bank as it is used in the ASTRON APERTIF project. The Polyphase Filter Bank is implemented in two steps: first in Haskell as being close to a standard mathematical specification, then in CλaSH which is derived from the Haskell formulation by applying only minor changes. We show that the CλaSH formulation can be directly mapped to hardware, thus exploiting the parallelism and concurrency that is present in the original mathematical specification.},

	Abstract = {In today's financial markets, where most trades are performed in their entirety by electronic means and the largest fraction of them is completely automated, an opportunity has risen from analyzing this vast amount of transactions. Since all the transactions are recorded in great detail, investors can analyze all the generated data and detect repeated patterns of the price movements. Being able to detect them in advance, allows them to take profitable positions or avoid anomalous events in the financial markets. In this work we proposed a deep learning methodology, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that predicts the price movements of stocks, using as input large-scale, high-frequency time-series derived from the order book of financial exchanges. The dataset that we use contains more than 4 million limit order events and our comparison with other methods, like Multilayer Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, shows that CNNs are better suited for this kind of task.},
