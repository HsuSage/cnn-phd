abstract = {The content-addressable network (CAN) is an efficient, intrinsically discrete training algorithm for binary-valued classification networks. The binary nature of the CAN network permits accelerated learning and significantly reduced hardware-implementation requirements. A multilayer optoelectronic CAN network employing matrix--vector multiplication was constructed. The network learned and correctly classified trained patterns, gaining a measure of fault tolerance by learning associative solutions to optical hardware imperfections. Operation of this system is possible owing to the reduced hardware accuracy requirements of the CAN learning algorithm.},
