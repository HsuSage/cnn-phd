It is able to generate a set of rules in if-then form underlying an unknown classification problem starting from a training set of samples. The performance of HC has been evaluated through a variety of artificial and real-world benchmarks. In particular, its application in the diagnosis of breast cancer has led to the derivation of a reduced set of rules solving the associated classification problem.}, keywords={neural nets;learning algorithm;Hamming clustering;binary neural networks;breast cancer;pattern classification;patient diagnosis;Boolean function}, doi={10.1049/cp:19991161}, ISSN={0537-9989}, month={Sept},}
