abstract="In this paper, we analyze characteristics of GA-based learning method of Binary Neural Networks (BNN). First, we consider coding methods to a chromosome in a GA and discuss the necessary chromosome length for a learning of BNN. Then, we compare some selection methods in a GA. We show that the learning results can be obtained in the less number of generations by properly setting selection methods and parameters in a GA. We also show that the quality of the learning results can be almost the same as that of the conventional method. These results can be verified by numerical experiments.",
