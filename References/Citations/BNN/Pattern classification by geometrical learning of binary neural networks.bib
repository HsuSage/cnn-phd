An expand-and-truncate learning (ETL) algorithm is used to determine the required number of neurons as well as the connecting weights in a three-layered feedforward network for classifying input patterns. The ETL algorithm is guaranteed to find a network for any binary-to-binary mappings. The ETL algorithm's performance in pattern classification is tested using a breast cancer database that have been used for benchmarking performance other machine learning methods.}, keywords={feedforward neural nets;pattern classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;geometrical learning;binary neural networks;pattern classification;expand-and-truncate learning algorithm;connecting weights;three-layered feedforward network;binary-to-binary mappings;breast cancer database;Pattern classification;Neural networks;Neurons;Machine learning algorithms;Testing;Breast cancer;Databases;Hamming distance;Computer networks;Joining processes}, doi={10.1109/IJCNN.1993.714090}, ISSN={}, month={Oct},}
