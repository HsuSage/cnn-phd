abstract="This paper studies application of the dynamic binary neural network to control signal of switching circuits. The network is characterized by the signum activation function and ternary weighting parameters. In the application, the teacher signal is one binary periodic orbit corresponding to the controls. The learning algorithm is based on the genetic algorithm. As an application object, we consider a control signal of the basic matrix converter. Performing a basic numerical experiment, we have confirmed that the teacher signal is stored successfully and is stabilized automatically.",
