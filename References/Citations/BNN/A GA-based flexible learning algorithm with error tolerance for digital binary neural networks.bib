In the learning, the genetic algorithms is used with flexible fitness that tolerates error: it is suitable to reduce the number of hidden neurons and to tolerate noise and outliers. We then apply the algorithm to design of cellular automata with rich spatio-temporal patterns and various applications. Performing basic numerical experiment, the algorithm efficiency is confirmed.}, keywords={Boolean functions;cellular automata;function approximation;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;flexible learning algorithm;error tolerance;digital binary neural networks;Boolean function approximation;genetic algorithms;cellular automata;spatio-temporal patterns;Neural networks;Signal processing algorithms;Neurons;Boolean functions;Approximation algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Noise reduction;Nonlinear dynamical systems;USA Councils;Algorithm design and analysis}, doi={10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178979}, ISSN={2161-4393}, month={June},}
