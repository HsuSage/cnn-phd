The computational effort of today's CNNs requires power-hungry parallel processors or GP-GPUs. Recent developments in CNN accelerators for system-on-chip integration have reduced energy consumption significantly. Unfortunately, even these highly optimized devices are above the power envelope imposed by mobile and deeply embedded applications and face hard limitations caused by CNN weight I/O and storage. This prevents the adoption of CNNs in future ultralow power Internet of Things end-nodes for near-sensor analytics. Recent algorithmic and theoretical advancements enable competitive classification accuracy even when limiting CNNs to binary (+1/-1) weights during training. These new findings bring major optimization opportunities in the arithmetic core by removing the need for expensive multiplications, as well as reducing I/O bandwidth and storage. In this paper, we present an accelerator optimized for binary-weight CNNs that achieves 1.5 TOp/s at 1.2 V on a core area of only 1.33 million gate equivalent (MGE) or 1.9 mm<sup>2</sup>and with a power dissipation of 895 Î¼W in UMC 65-nm technology at 0.6 V. Our accelerator significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of energy and area efficiency achieving 61.2 TOp/s/W@0.6 V and 1.1 TOp/s/MGE@1.2 V, respectively.}, keywords={CMOS logic circuits;computer vision;convolution;coprocessors;embedded systems;image classification;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;neural nets;optimisation;power aware computing;system-on-chip;I/O storage;I/O bandwidth;algorithmic advancements;binary weights;competitive classification accuracy;hard limitations;deeply embedded applications;mobile embedded applications;power envelope;energy consumption;system-on-chip integration;CNN accelerators;GP-GPUs;power-hungry parallel processors;computational effort;human accuracy;image classification;computer vision;convolutional neural networks;ultralow power binary-weight CNN acceleration;power dissipation;binary-weight CNNs;accelerator;optimization opportunities;ASIC;binary weights;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);hardware accelerator;Internet of Things (IoT)}, doi={10.1109/TCAD.2017.2682138}, ISSN={0278-0070}, month={Jan},}
