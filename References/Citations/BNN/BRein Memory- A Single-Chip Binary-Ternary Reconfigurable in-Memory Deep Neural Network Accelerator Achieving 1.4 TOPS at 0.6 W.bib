In-memory neural network processing without any external data accesses, sustained by the symmetry and simplicity of the computation of the binary/ternaty neural network, improves the energy efficiency dramatically. The prototype chip is fabricated, and it achieves 1.4 TOPS (tera operations per second) peak performance with 0.6-W power consumption at 400-MHz clock. The application examination is also conducted.}, keywords={low-power electronics;neural nets;random-access storage;reconfigurable architectures;deep neural network accelerator;binary/ternary deep neural networks;In-memory neural network processing;binary/ternaty neural network;BRein memory;single-chip binary/ternary reconfigurable in-memory;reconfigurable accelerator architecture;external data access;power 0.6 W;frequency 400 MHz;Biological neural networks;Random access memory;Memory management;Neurons;System-on-chip;Parallel processing;Binary neural networks;in-memory processing;near-memory processing;neural networks;reconfigurable array;ternary neural networks}, doi={10.1109/JSSC.2017.2778702}, ISSN={0018-9200}, month={April},}
