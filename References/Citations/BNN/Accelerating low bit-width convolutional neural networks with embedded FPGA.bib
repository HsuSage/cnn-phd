Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) with binarized weights and activations can simplify computation but suffer from obvious accuracy loss. In this paper, low bit-width CNNs, BNNs and standard CNNs are compared to show that low bit-width CNNs is better suited for embedded systems. An architecture based on the two-stage arithmetic unit (TSAU) as the basic processing element is proposed to process each layer iteratively for low bit-width CNN accelerators. Then the DoReFa-Net which is trained with weights and activations represented in 1 bit and 2 bits respectively is implemented on Zynq XC7Z020 FPGA with a 410.2 GOPS performance. The accelerator can meet the real-time requirement of embedded applications with a 106 FPS throughput and a 73.1% top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. The accelerator outperforms existing FPGA-based CNN accelerators in the tradeoff among accuracy, energy and resource efficiency.}, keywords={digital arithmetic;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;neural nets;low bit-width CNN accelerators;Zynq XC7Z020 FPGA;DoReFa-Net neural nets;two-stage arithmetic unit;embedded systems;embedded systems;binarized activations;binarized weights;Binarized Neural Networks;complex computation;high classification accuracy;embedded FPGA;low bit-width convolutional neural networks;Kernel;Field programmable gate arrays;Table lookup;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Quantization (signal);Convolution}, doi={10.23919/FPL.2017.8056820}, ISSN={1946-1488}, month={Sept},}
