abstract="This paper presents an ultra-high-speed sorter based upon a simplified parallel sorting algorithm using a binary neural network which consists both of binary neurons and of AND-OR synaptic connections to solve sorting problems at two and only two clock cycles. Our simplified algorithm is based on the super parallel sorting algorithm proposed by Takefuji and Lee. Nevertheless, our algorithm does not need any adders, while Takefuji's algorithm needs n{\texttimes}(nâˆ’1) analog adders of which each has multiple input ports. For an example of the simplified parallel sorter, a hardware design and its implementation will be introduced in this paper, which performs a sorting operation at two clock cycles. Both results of a logic circuit simulation and of an algorithm simulation show the justice of our hardware implementation even if in the practical size of the problem.",
