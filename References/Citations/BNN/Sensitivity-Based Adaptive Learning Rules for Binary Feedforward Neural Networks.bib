The rules are based on three basic adaptive learning principles: the benefit principle, the minimal disturbance principle, and the burden-sharing principle. In order to follow the benefit principle and the minimal disturbance principle, a neuron selection rule and a weight adaptation rule are developed. Besides, a learning control rule is developed to follow the burden-sharing principle. The advantage of the rules is that they can effectively guide the BFNN's learning to conduct constructive adaptations and avoid destructive ones. With these rules, a sensitivity-based adaptive learning (SBALR) algorithm for BFNNs is presented. Experimental results on a number of benchmark data demonstrate that the SBALR algorithm has better learning performance than the Madaline rule II and backpropagation algorithms.}, keywords={feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);sensitivity analysis;sensitivity-based adaptive learning rules;binary feedforward neural network;sensitivity measurement;BFNN weight variation;adaptive learning principles;benefit principle;minimal disturbance principle;burden-sharing principle;neuron selection rule;weight adaptation rule;learning control rule;BFNN learning;benchmark data;SBALR algorithm;Madaline rule II;backpropagation algorithm;Neurons;Sensitivity;Training;Learning systems;Weight measurement;Biological neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Adaptive learning algorithm;binary feedforward neural networks;learning rule;sensitivity;Artificial Intelligence;Databases, Factual;Neural Networks (Computer)}, doi={10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2177860}, ISSN={2162-237X}, month={March},}
