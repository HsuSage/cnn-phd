However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.}, keywords={image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;visual categorization;transfer learning algorithms;object recognition;image classification;human action recognition;Knowledge transfer;Visualization;Training;Training data;Adaptation models;Learning systems;Testing;Action recognition;image classification;machine learning;object recognition;survey;transfer learning;visual categorization.;Action recognition;image classification;machine learning;object recognition;survey;transfer learning;visual categorization;Algorithms;Humans;Knowledge;Machine Learning;Models, Theoretical;Neural Networks (Computer);Surveys and Questionnaires;Transfer (Psychology);Visual Perception}, doi={10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2330900}, ISSN={2162-237X}, month={May},}
