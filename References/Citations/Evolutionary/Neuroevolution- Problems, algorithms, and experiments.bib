The authors have suggested neuro evolutional algorithm and presented experiment results on a standard task: the balancing trolley with two flagpoles of different lengths.}, keywords={evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;neural nets;machine learning;neural networks;adaptive management;multiagent systems;evolutionary robotics;gaming strategies;computer art;neuro evolutional algorithm;balancing trolley;Biological neural networks;Neurons;Encoding;Sociology;Statistics;Topology;Head;Neuroevolution;reinforcement machine learning;optimization;evolutionary computation;fitness function}, doi={10.1109/ICAICT.2016.7991745}, ISSN={2472-8586}, month={Oct},}
