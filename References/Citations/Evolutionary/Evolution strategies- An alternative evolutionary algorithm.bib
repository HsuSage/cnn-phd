abstract="In this paper, evolution strategies (ESs) --- a class of evolutionary algorithms using normally distributed mutations, recombination, deterministic selection of the $\mu$>1 best offspring individuals, and the principle of self-adaptation for the collective on-line learning of strategy parameters --- are described by demonstrating their differences to genetic algorithms. By comparison of the algorithms, it is argued that the application of canonical genetic algorithms for continuous parameter optimization problems implies some difficulties caused by the encoding of continuous object variables by binary strings and the constant mutation rate used in genetic algorithms. Because they utilize a problem-adequate representation and a suitable self-adaptive step size control guaranteeing linear convergence for strictly convex problems, evolution strategies are argued to be more adequate for continuous problems.",
