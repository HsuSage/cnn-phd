Cooperative coevolution has been combined as memetic cooperative neuroevolution with application to chaotic time series prediction. Although the method has shown promising performance, there are limitations in the balance between global and local search. The previous study used a specific local search strategy for intensification that affected the diversity of solutions. In this study, we address this limitation by information (meme) collection strategies that maintains and refines a pool of memes during global search. We present two strategies where one is sequential and the other is concurrent meme collection implemented at different stages of evolution. In the majority of the given problems, the proposed strategies showed improvement in prediction accuracy over the related methods.}, keywords={evolutionary computation;search problems;social sciences;time series;memetic algorithms;neuroevolution;coevolution;chaotic time series prediction;global search;specific local search strategy;information collection strategies;concurrent meme collection;prediction accuracy;Memetics;Time series analysis;Neurons;Prediction algorithms;Sociology;Cooperative Coevolution;Memetic Algorithms;Time Series Prediction Global Search;Local Search;Neuroevolution}, doi={10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489184}, ISSN={2161-4407}, month={July},}
