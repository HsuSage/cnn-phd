The nature of its reproduction operator limits its application to continuous-valued search spaces. However, a simple discretization procedure can be used to convert floating-point solution vectors into discrete-valued vectors. This paper considers three approaches in which differential evolution can be used to solve problems with binary-valued parameters. The first approach is based on a homomorphous mapping, while the second approach interprets the floating-point solution vector as a vector of probabilities, used to decide on the appropriate binary value. The third approach normalizes solution vectors and then discretize these normalized vectors to form a bitstring. Empirical results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of both methods in comparison with particle swarm optimizers.}, keywords={evolutionary computation;optimisation;binary differential evolution;population-based optimization;reproduction operator;continuous-valued search space;simple discretization procedure;floating-point solution vectors;discrete-valued vectors;binary-valued parameters;homomorphous mapping;normalized vectors;particle swarm optimizers;Optimization methods;Genetic mutations;Particle swarm optimization;Probability density function;Arithmetic;Biological cells;Difference equations;Differential equations;Stochastic processes;Discrete transforms}, doi={10.1109/CEC.2007.4424711}, ISSN={1089-778X}, month={Sept},}
