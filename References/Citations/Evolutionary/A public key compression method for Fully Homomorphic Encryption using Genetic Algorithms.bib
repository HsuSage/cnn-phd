This method is suitable for use in untrusted environments, such as cloud computing platforms. Various methods have been proposed to implement this technique. But the greatest problem of these methods is that for its operation, there is the need to generate public keys with large sizes, whose immediate consequence is to cause such encryption schemes not reach the desired runtime performance. This article aims to optimize public keys compression techniques using Genetic Algorithms (GA) for parameter calibration of Coron test variants primitives in order to speed up the execution time of each of these primitives.}, keywords={genetic algorithms;public key cryptography;fully homomorphic encryption;genetic algorithms;FHE;encrypted data;cloud computing platforms;public keys compression;GA;parameter calibration;Coron test variants primitives;Encryption;Public key;Genetic algorithms;Proposals;Sociology;Fully Homomorphic Encryption;Compression;Security;Genetic Algorithm}, doi={}, ISSN={}, month={July},}
