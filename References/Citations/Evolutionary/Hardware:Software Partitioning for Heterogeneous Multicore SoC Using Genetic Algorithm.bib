abstract={Hardware/software partitioning is a crucial problem in hardware/software co-design. In this paper, we deeply investigate genetic algorithm (GA) for hardware/software partitioning, our co-design targets a heterogeneous multicore system on chip (SoC) which consists of several different types of processing engines(PE), Communicating structure adopts NOC, We use GA for four task graphs to simulate the hardware/software partitioning, experiments show our method is an effective hardware/software partitioning algorithm.},
