abstract="This chapter discusses the numerous reasons for why one might wish to study the subject of neuroevolution. I cover a number of different applications of such a system, giving examples and scenarios of a neuroevolutionary system being applied within a variety of different fields. A discussion then follows on where all of this research is heading, and what the next step within this field might be. Finally, a whirlwind introduction of the book is given, with a short summary of what is covered in every chapter.",
