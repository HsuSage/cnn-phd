Experimental results had better precision and much lower computational cost compared to the literature related to this concept in the Wisions breast cancer data set.}, keywords={cancer;genetic algorithms;medical image processing;neural nets;artificial neural network;breast cancer diagnosis;women;adaptive genetic algorithm;macro-search capability;global optimization;computational cost;Wisions breast cancer data set;Artificial neural networks;Breast cancer;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Flowcharts;Economic forecasting;Space technology;Data mining;Conference management;Knowledge management;adaptive genetic algorithm;neural network;weights and thresholds;breast cancer diagnosis}, doi={10.1109/WKDD.2010.148}, ISSN={}, month={Jan},}
