In neuroevolution, artificial neural networks are trained through evolutionary algorithms, taking inspiration from the way biological brains evolved. We analyze the application of NE in games along five different axes, which are the role NE is chosen to play in a game, the different types of neural networks used, the way these networks are evolved, how the fitness is determined and what type of input the network receives. The paper also highlights important open research challenges in the field.}, keywords={computer games;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;neuroevolution;NE;computer game;artificial neural network training;evolutionary algorithm;Games;Artificial intelligence;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Biological neural networks;Network topology;Evolutionary algorithms;neural networks;neuroevolution}, doi={10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2494596}, ISSN={1943-068X}, month={March},}
