abstract="In recent years, the use of hybrid Soft Computing methods has shown that in various applications the synergism of several techniques is superior to a single technique. For example, the use of a neural fuzzy system and an evolutionary fuzzy system hybridises the approximate reasoning mechanism of fuzzy systems with the learning capabilities of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary neural systems hybridise the neurocomputing approach with the solution-searching ability of evolutionary computing. Such hybrid methodologies retain limitations that can be overcome with full integration of the three basic Soft Computing paradigms, and this leads to evolutionary neural fuzzy systems. The objective of this chapter is to provide an account of hybrid Soft Computing systems, with special attention to the combined use of evolutionary algorithms and neural networks in order to endow fuzzy systems with learning and adaptive capabilities. After an introduction to basic Soft Computing paradigms, the various forms of hybridisation are considered, which results in evolutionary neural fuzzy systems. The chapter also describes a particular approach that jointly uses neural learning and genetic optimisation to learn a fuzzy model from the given data and to optimise it for accuracy and interpretability.",
