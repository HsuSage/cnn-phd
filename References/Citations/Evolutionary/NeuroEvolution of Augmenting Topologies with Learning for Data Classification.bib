In this paper, we propose a hybrid training scheme Learning-NEAT (L-NEAT) for data classification problem. L-NEAT simplifies evolution by dividing the complete problem domain into sub tasks and learn the sub tasks by incorporating back propagation rule into the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The new algorithm combines the strength of searching for topology and weights from NEAT and back propagation respectively while overcoming problems associated with direct use of NEAT. We claim that L-NEAT can produce neural network for classification problem effectively and efficiently. Empirical evaluation shows that L-NEAT evolves classifying neural network with good generalization ability. Its accuracy outperforms original NEAT.}, keywords={backpropagation;evolutionary computation;neural nets;pattern classification;search problems;topology;neuroevolution of augmenting topologies;augmenting topology;data classification learning;neural network;learning-NEAT training scheme;backpropagation;search problem;Network topology;Artificial neural networks;Neural networks;Supervised learning;Biological cells;Information technology;Evolutionary computation;Unsupervised learning;Technological innovation}, doi={10.1109/ICINFA.2006.374100}, ISSN={2151-1802}, month={Dec},}
