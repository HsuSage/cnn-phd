abstract="This paper proposes a novel approach for the evolution of artificial creatures which moves in a 3D virtual environment based on the neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The NEAT algorithm is used to evolve neural networks that observe the virtual environment and respond to it, by controlling the muscle force of the creature. The genetic algorithmÂ is used to emerge the architecture of creature based on the distance metrics for fitness evaluation. The damaged morphologies of creature are elaborated, and a crossover algorithm is used to control it. Creatures with similar morphological traits are grouped into the same species to limit the complexity of the search space. The motion of virtual creature having 2--3 limbs is recorded at three different angles to check their performance in different types of viscous mediums. The qualitative demonstration of motion of virtual creature represents that improved swimming of virtual creatures is achieved in simulating mediums with viscous drag 1--10 arbitrary unit.",
