abstract="This chapter discusses some of the trends in deep learning and related fields. We cover specifically which trends might be useful for what tasks as well as discuss some of the methods and ideas that could have far-reaching implications but have yet to be applied to many real-world problems. We finish by covering briefly some of the current limitations of deep learning as well as some other areas of AI that seem to hold promise for future AI applications, and discuss briefly some of the ethical and legal implications of deep learning applications.",
