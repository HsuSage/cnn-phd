%T Co-simulation between CλaSH and traditional HDLs
%U http://essay.utwente.nl/70777/
%X CλaSH is a functional hardware description language (HDL) developed at the CAES  group of the University of Twente. CλaSH borrows both the syntax and semantics from the general-purpose functional programming language Haskell, meaning that circuit designers can define their circuits with regular Haskell syntax.    In this thesis, research is done on the co-simulation of CλaSH and traditional HDLs. The Verilog Procedural Interface (VPI), as defined in the IEEE 1364 standard, is used to set-up the communication and to control a Verilog simulator. An implementation is made, as will be described in this thesis, to show the practical feasibility of co-simulation of CλaSH and Verilog.
