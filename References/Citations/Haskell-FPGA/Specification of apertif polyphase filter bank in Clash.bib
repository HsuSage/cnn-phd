title = "Specification of APERTIF Polyphase Filter Bank in CλaSH",
abstract = "CλaSH, a functional hardware description language based on Haskell, has several abstraction mechanisms that allow a hardware designer to describe architectures in a short and concise way. In this paper we evaluate CλaSH on a complex DSP application, a Polyphase Filter Bank as it is used in the ASTRON APERTIF project. The Polyphase Filter Bank is implemented in two steps: first in Haskell as being close to a standard mathematical specification, then in CλaSH which is derived from the Haskell formulation by applying only minor changes. We show that the CλaSH formulation can be directly mapped to hardware, thus exploiting the parallelism and concurrency that is present in the original mathematical specification.",
