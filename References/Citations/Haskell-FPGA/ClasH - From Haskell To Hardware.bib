abstract = "Functional hardware description languages are a class of hardware description languages that emphasize on the ability to express higher level structural properties, such a parameterization and regularity. Due to such features as higher-order functions and polymorphism, parameterization in functional hardware description languages is more natural than the parameterization support found in the more traditional hardware description languages, like VHDL and Verilog. We de- velop a new functional hardware description language, CÎ»asH, that borrows both the syntax and semantics from the general-purpose functional programming language Haskell.",
