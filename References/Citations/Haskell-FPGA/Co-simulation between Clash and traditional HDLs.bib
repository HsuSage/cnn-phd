        abstract = {ClaSH is a functional hardware description language (HDL) developed at the CAES
group of the University of Twente. ClaSH borrows both the syntax and semantics from the general-purpose functional programming language Haskell, meaning that circuit designers can define their circuits with regular Haskell syntax.

In this thesis, research is done on the co-simulation of ClaSH and traditional HDLs. The Verilog Procedural Interface (VPI), as defined in the IEEE 1364 standard, is used to set-up the communication and to control a Verilog simulator. An implementation is made, as will be described in this thesis, to show the practical feasibility of co-simulation of ClaSH and Verilog.}
