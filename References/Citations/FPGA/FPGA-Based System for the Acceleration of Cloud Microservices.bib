The atomic network services offered by cloud architectures are called microservices. Unlike virtual machines, microservices can be implemented in the form of low resources footprint applications as containers (Docker, LXC etc.) or even smaller as unikernels (IncludeOS, ClickOS, Rumprun, HermitOS etc.). The need to efficiently offload the processing of computation-intensive applications has motivated the introduction of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) boards in servers. FPGAs can nowadays be considered as cloud-standard processing resources. However, in today's cloud data centers, FPGAs cannot be accessed to run concurrent microservices. This severely limits the efficient deployment of microservices. This paper aims at introducing an FPGA-based system for the concurrent acceleration of cloud-native microservices onto FPGAs.}, keywords={cloud computing;computer centres;field programmable gate arrays;open systems;FPGA-based system;concurrent acceleration;cloud-native microservices;cloud microservices;interoperability;modularity;cloud computing;legacy data center;atomic network services;cloud architectures;virtual machines;low resources footprint applications;computation-intensive applications;Field Programmable Gate Arrays boards;cloud-standard processing resources;cloud data centers;concurrent microservices;Field programmable gate arrays;Acceleration;Cloud computing;Servers;Containers;Computer architecture;FPGA;Cloud;Microservice;Acceleration}, doi={10.1109/BMSB.2018.8436912}, ISSN={2155-5052}, month={June},}
