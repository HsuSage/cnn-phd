The main design is divided into several modules. The modules are autonomous in operation once the system starts to run. They communicate with each other using a handshaking protocol. Three applications are then experimented using the PPHGA to test its optimization power. These are linear interpolation, thermistor data processing, and vehicle acceleration computation.}, keywords={field programmable gate arrays;parallel programming;pipeline processing;program testing;hardware description languages;logic testing;genetic algorithms;logic programming;logic design;interpolation;thermistors;protocols;parallel-pipelined hardware genetic algorithm;very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language;VHDL;field programmable gate array;gate arrays programming;FPGA design;handshaking protocol;program testing;optimization power;linear interpolation;thermistor data processing;vehicle acceleration computation;lateral acceleration;Genetic algorithms;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit synthesis;Very high speed integrated circuits;Hardware design languages;Parallel programming;Protocols;Circuit testing;Interpolation;Thermistors}, doi={10.1109/NRSC.2004.240504}, ISSN={}, month={March},}
