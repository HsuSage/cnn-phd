Achieving state of the art accuracy in CNNs often results in large models and complex topologies that require significant compute resources to complete in a timely manner. Binarised neural networks (BNNs) have been proposed as an optimised variant of CNNs, which constrain the weights and activations to +1 or -1 and thus offer compact models and lower computational complexity per operation. This paper presents a high performance BNN accelerator on the Intel®Xeon+FPGA™ platform. The proposed accelerator is designed to take advantage of the Xeon+FPGA system in a way that a specialised FPGA architecture can be targeted for the most compute intensive parts of the BNN whilst other parts of the topology can be handled by the Xeon™ CPU. The implementation is evaluated by comparing the raw compute performance and energy efficiency for key layers in standard CNN topologies against an Nvidia Titan X Pascal GPU and other published FPGA BNN accelerators. The results show that our single-package integrated Arria™ 10 FPGA accelerator coupled with a high-end Xeon CPU can offer comparable performance and better energy efficiency than a high-end discrete Titan X GPU card. In addition, our solution delivers the best performance compared to previous BNN FPGA implementations.}, keywords={computational complexity;field programmable gate arrays;graphics processing units;image recognition;neural nets;object detection;high performance binary neural networks;convolutional neural networks;CNN;Xeon CPU;Intel Xeon+FPGA platform;FPGA BNN accelerators;Nvidia Titan X Pascal GPU;specialised FPGA architecture;Xeon+FPGA system;high performance BNN accelerator;lower computational complexity;complex topologies;object detection applications;scene segmentation;image recognition;Field programmable gate arrays;Graphics processing units;Topology;Computer architecture;Performance evaluation;Network topology;IP networks}, doi={10.23919/FPL.2017.8056823}, ISSN={1946-1488}, month={Sept},}
