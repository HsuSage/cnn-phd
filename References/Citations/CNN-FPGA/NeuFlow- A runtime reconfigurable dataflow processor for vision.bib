This system was designed with the goal of providing real-time detection, categorization and localization of objects in complex scenes, while consuming 10 Watts when implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA platform, or about ten times less than a laptop computer, and producing speedups of up to 100 times in real-world applications. We present an application of the system on street scene analysis, segmenting 20 categories on 500 Ã— 375 frames at 12 frames per second on our custom hardware neuFlow.}, keywords={computer vision;field programmable gate arrays;flow graphs;NeuFlow;runtime reconfigurable dataflow processor;scalable dataflow hardware architecture;dataflow compiler;luaFlow;flow graph representations;machine code;Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA platform;laptop computer;Tiles;Computer architecture;Runtime;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Convolvers;Feature extraction}, doi={10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981829}, ISSN={2160-7508}, month={June},}
